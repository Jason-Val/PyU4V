# PyU4V
A library showing some of the functionality possible using the ReST API of EMC's UniSphere for VMAX.
Most of the heavy lifting was done for me; this code has been adapted from https://github.com/scottbri/PyVMAX  

To give it a try, download the files and add your server details to the top of the rest_univmax file.
Then use the example.py file as, well, an example, and start calling functions!
Make sure to call the set_array() function first with the array you wish to query.

This is only a very basic introduction to some of the things you could do. 
I'm hoping to expand on it more in the near future.
